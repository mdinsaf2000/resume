		Dear Mr. Rakesh Kumar,

I am writing to express my interest in the Front-End Developer position at Vipro Company. With 3 years of experience in web development and a passion for creating user-friendly interfaces, I am confident that I would be a great fit for your team.<br>

In my current role at Capgemini Company, I have been responsible for developing and implementing responsive designs for several high-profile clients. My technical skills include proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery, as well as experience working with various content management systems such as WordPress and Shopify.<br>

One of my proudest achievements was leading the development of a custom e-commerce platform for a fashion brand, which resulted in a 25% increase in online sales. I have also worked on several projects where I collaborated closely with designers to ensure that the final product met both aesthetic and functional requirements.<br>

I am drawn to Vipro Company because of its reputation for innovative design and commitment to user experience. I believe that my technical skills and passion for front-end development would make me a valuable addition to your team. Thank you for considering my application.<br><br>

Sincerely,<br>
Mohd. Insaf
